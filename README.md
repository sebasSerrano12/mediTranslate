# MediTranslate
MediTranslate is an app that provides a triage questionnaire for medical providers to communicate with Spanish-speaking patients. It helps ensure accurate and efficient acquiring of medical information, bridging the language barrier in healthcare settings.

## How It's Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wanted to make this app interactive. The code stores a set of English medical questions and their Spanish translations in an object. When the user clicks a button, it randomly selects one of the questions, displays both the English and Spanish versions on the screen, and shows them in a designated area. This app is responsive and should work on different screen sizes and devices.

## Optimizations

Eventually, I want to implement an language API that translates to other languagues, not just Spanish.

## Lessons Learned

I learned that simple features like randomizing content and dynamically updating the UI can significantly enhance user experience, making the app more engaging and improving its overall functionality and interaction. These features create a more interactive environment, keeping users engaged and improving usability.
