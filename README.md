## How it was Made: 

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

I wanted to make this app interactive. The code stores a set of English medical questions and their Spanish translations in an object. When the user clicks a button, it randomly selects one of the questions, displays both the English and Spanish versions on the screen, and shows them in a designated area. This app is responsive and should work on different screen sizes and devices.

## Optimizations

I want to build a Barnav

Eventually, I want to implement an language API that translates to other languagues, not just Spanish.
I also want to add components 

## Lessons Learned

I learned that simple features like randomizing content and dynamically updating the UI can significantly enhance user experience, making the app more engaging and improving its overall functionality and interaction. These features create a more interactive environment, keeping users engaged and improving usability.
